%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section

\section{\sc Research Experience}
\textbf{Masterâ€™s Thesis,}\textit{ Under the Supervision of Prof. Hossein Sameti }  \hfill{  2020 â€“ 2022 }

		My master's thesis focused on improving the performance of conversational question answering models. After studying and implementing different ideas within the field, I recently participated in ACL's MultiDoc2Dial workshop, where our model stood fifth. Currently, I am working on implementing my new ideas to improve the proposed model even further, the result of which will be published in my upcoming paper Docalog++.

\vspace{0.185cm}

\textbf{B.Sc Internship Period,} \textit{ Under the Supervision of Prof. Mahdi Tale Masouleh} \hfill{  2017 â€“ 2018 }

		As a researcher in the Human and Robot Interaction lab, I worked on a Delta robot with 3 degrees of freedom and specialized in its artificial intelligence. The first step was to develop a conveyor belt system, and the second was to design a vision system for the pick and place process. Image processing was used to detect special, but simple objects, and suction was used to pick them up.

\section{\sc Work Experience}
\textbf{Data Scientist,} \textit{ASR Gooyesh Pardaz} \hfill{  Feb 2022 - Aug 2022}


	I was engaged in three projects in this company. One was to develop a smart chatbot to automatically answer the questions of the customers on various websites, easing the role of customer support. We used different question answering and machine comprehension ideas to improve our chatbot. The other one was deep noise suppression and utilizing the SOTA models to develop an industrial API for the task. In the last project, we explored the possibilities and challenges of creating a knowledge graph over the Farsi language and we developed this knowledge graph to some extent.

\textbf{Backend Developer,} \textit{Idearun Co.} \hfill{  Jan 2019 - Jan 2020 }

	During this period I worked on two different projects. The first one was a platform for barberries to automatize their reservations and also payments. This project had two major sections. One section for the barbers should the web browser to connect to the platform and the other section is designed for their customers who should use our application installed on their phones. The second project was a payment platform in which merchants could create payment forms and could share them with people to pay by connecting to the third-party payment gates. These projects were implemented using the Django framework and Rest API which are both libraries of python.
	
 \vspace{0.185cm}

\textbf{Freelance Python Developer,} \textit{Home}
 \hfill{  May 2017 - Jan 2020 }

	I have done many projects as a freelancer. I have created websites using Django as the back-end framework for people. My other projects include web scraping and web crawling, developing scripts for various APIs, or providing desired APIs. Some of my projects are open-source and available on my GitHub.
